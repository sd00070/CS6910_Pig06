# Assumptions

## Your Initial Commit
> Same as the last week, for some reason, I can see your original commit, and git diff cannot find any file changes, but the git CLI is still requiring me to recommit those original files. As it wasn't an issue last week, I'm assuming it won't be an issue this week to recommit the initial files.

## Not all commits will be an MVP
> I traditionally try to make sure all of my commits pass CheckStyle and all of their unit tests, but, in order to show the work of this week, in the correct order, many of my commits will have failing tests. I am assuming that is the best way to go in order to present the Behavior Driven Development.
